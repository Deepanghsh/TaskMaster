TaskMaster: Modern Productivity & Secure Organization

TaskMaster is a powerful, React-based task management application designed for efficient daily planning and tracking. It provides a central Dashboard and dedicated Upcoming and Calendar views to keep scheduling simple. Core features include assigning Priority levels, organizing tasks with color-coded Categories, and archiving completed items to maintain clarity.

The application also features robust Settings for user control, offering seamless Dark/Light Mode toggling. For data security, all profile changes require password verification, and account deletion uses a secure, GitHub-style confirmation (typing a phrase), ensuring your data is protected and managed with intention.
